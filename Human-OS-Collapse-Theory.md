# Human OS Collapse Theory | Adaptation to Merge Era

## Abstract
Cognitive architectures evolved for static social systems. Under recursive tech acceleration, these OS structures collapse without adaptive protocols.

### Framework: CCRP
- **Collapse** – Ego integrity loss under systemic overload.
- **Coherence** – Reassembly via meta-framework (Merge OS).
- **Rebuild** – Emergent self + AI-integrated decision loop.

### Research Relevance
Understanding collapse mechanics is critical for designing ethical Merge transitions.
